# shell-with-auth-ngrx
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/yiqu/shell-with-auth-ngrx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/yiqu/shell-with-auth-ngrx)

This is a shell application that uses Firebase Fire Store as the database, and NgRx as the state manager.

# Using this shell

Replace the Firebase config in environment.ts file with your own Firebase config.

```
firebaseConfig: {
    apiKey: xxx
    authDomain: xxx
    databaseURL: xxx
    projectId: xxx
    storageBucket: xxx
    messagingSenderId: xxx
    appId: xxx
}
```

This config can be found in your Firebase Console's project page.

Remove .firebaserc file and firebase.json. These two files are generated by running the deployment initializtion steps.

# Host your app on Firebase

```
firebase login
```

```
firebase init
```

```
firebase deploy
```
