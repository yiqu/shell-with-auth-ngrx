# shell-with-auth-ngrx
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/yiqu/shell-with-auth-ngrx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/yiqu/shell-with-auth-ngrx)

This is a shell application that uses Firebase Fire Store as the database, and NgRx as the state manager.

Latest: [Github Pages](https://yiqu.github.io/shell-with-auth-ngrx)

Stable: [Firebase Hosted](https://kq-1-1a499.web.app/)

## Using this shell

### Link up your Firebase backend

First we need to configure the project with your own Firebase backend configuration. Replace the Firebase config in environment.ts file with your own Firebase config.

```
firebaseConfig: {
    apiKey: xxx
    authDomain: xxx
    databaseURL: xxx
    projectId: xxx
    storageBucket: xxx
    messagingSenderId: xxx
    appId: xxx
}
```
This config can be found in your Firebase Console's project page.
Remove .firebaserc file and firebase.json. These two files are generated by running the deployment initializtion steps.

### Replace the PLACEHOLDER name entity

There is a PLACEHOLDER name that will need to be changed. Just CTRL+F for PLACEHOLDER and replace the String with your app's name.

### Firebase User Model

When a user register for an account, first this shell will register the user into Firebase. Second, it will then create a entry
in the Firestore database with the follow model:

```
export class VerifiedUser {
  constructor(
    public createdAt: string,
    public displayName: string,
    public email: string,
    public emailVerified: string,
    public isAnonymous: string,
    public lastLoginAt: string,
    public photoURL: string,
    public providerData: ProviderData[],
    public stsTokenManager: any,
    public tenantId: string,
    public uid: string,
    public phoneNumber: string,
    public inAppAliases: InAppAlias,
    public logins: string[]
  ) {
  }

}
```

The user will be stored in Firestore under the path of  /users/userId.

### Firestore Rules

Rules should be at least like the following:

```
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {


    match /users/{userId} {
    	allow read;
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /{userId}/{document=**} {
    	allow read: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

This will only allow user read/write their own documents after signing in.

## Host your app on Firebase

```
firebase login
```

```
firebase init
```

```
firebase deploy
```
